## [Unreleased]

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added

- **Encrypted Backup & Restore** (`BackupService`) — Full-screen Data Management page. All backups are encrypted with the vault's AES-256-GCM key. Regular backups auto-rotate (max 5) with version-timestamp filenames.
- **Special Backups** — Up to 5 user-named backups stored outside the rotation cycle. Support rename, restore, and delete. Can be created from current state or promoted from any regular backup.
- **Auto-Backup on Unlock** — `AuthNotifier` fires non-blocking backup creation after every successful vault unlock.
- **Auto-Backup on App Upgrade** — `AppVersionTracker` detects version changes and triggers a versioned backup on the first unlock after upgrade.
- **Backup Recovery Prompt** — `LoginPage` detects empty vault + existing backups and offers a restore dialog before creating default items.
- **Account Data Isolation** — `UnifiedObjectNotifier.loadFromProfile()` now resets state to empty when the new account's `unifiedObjects` is null, preventing old account data from leaking into the new account.
- **Default Page Deletion Protection** — `deleteObject()` blocks soft-deletion of `DefaultPageIds` (profile/travel/financial/professional).
- **Default Page Sidebar Filtering** — `AppSidebar` custom pages list now excludes the four built-in default pages.
- **Operation Notification Overlay** — Backup actions use `OperationNotification.show()` (top-floating overlay) instead of `ScaffoldMessenger` SnackBar.

### Changed

- **Data Management** — Moved from BottomSheet (`settings_page.dart`) to standalone page (`data_management_page.dart`) with `AppBar`, `RefreshIndicator`, and full-screen layout.
- **Restore Backup Order** — `restoreBackup()` now reads the target backup file into memory *before* calling `createBackup()` for the protective backup, preventing cleanup from deleting the file being restored.

### Fixed

- **Restore Oldest Backup Failed** — When 5 regular backups existed, the protective backup's cleanup would delete the oldest backup before it could be read. Fixed by reordering read-before-protect.
- **Date Masking Leak** — `_maskedValue()` threshold was 8 chars, causing `1997-08-19` (10 chars) to show `1997••••••••8-19`. Threshold raised to 12 chars for full masking of dates and short IDs.
- **Object Workspace Pop Crash** — `build()` auto-navigate and `_deleteCurrentObject()` both called `context.pop()`, causing double-pop `GoError`. Removed pop from delete, let build handle navigation.
- **Migration `StateError` Crash** — `_migrateProfileDataToUnified._sens()` used `firstWhere` with `on Exception catch`, but `StateError` (from missing field in `FieldRegistry.defaultFields`) is an `Error`, not `Exception`. Fixed to `catch (_)` and added `FormFieldRegistry.getField()` fallback.
- **Account Switch Data Leak** — New account login would display previous account's custom pages because `UnifiedObjectNotifier` state was never cleared when `profile.unifiedObjects == null`.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-27

### Added
- **Unified Object Model** - Everything is a `UnifiedObject` with `parentId`/`childrenIds` tree structure. Replaces legacy `FlexibleSection`/`FlexibleItem` models.
- **Persistent Sidebar (`AppSidebar`)** - Drag-resizable (180–400px), collapse/expand, with tree-structured custom pages (expand/collapse for nested sub-pages)
- **Object Workspace Page** - Page-centric UI showing children as cards with inline property editing; non-page children shown as list tiles
- **Object Editor Page** - Generic editor for creating/editing any `UnifiedObject` with icon picker, type selection (create-only), and parent assignment
- **Icon Picker Sheet** - Shared bottom-sheet component for selecting from 26 predefined Material icons
- **Lock Vault Confirmation Dialog** - Unified confirmation dialog before locking, with cancel/confirm buttons and tap-outside-to-dismiss
- **Data Size Display** - Settings page Account section now shows total vault data size (B/KB/MB/GB)
- **Property Editor Factory** - Type-aware inline property editors (text, number, date, checkbox, select, multi-select, relation, URL)
- **CHANGELOG.md** - Version history documentation
- **Rust FFI for Argon2id** (`crypto-argon2/`) - High-performance Argon2id key derivation using Rust SIMD optimizations for Apple Silicon
- **Change Password API** - `POST /api/auth/password` endpoint with full data re-encryption
- **Shared Header Component** - Left sidebar with navigation, account badge, and lock button shared across all auth pages
- **Request Timeout** - 10-second timeout on all API client requests to prevent hanging

### Changed
- **Schema Version** - Bumped to v3; `ProfileData` now uses `unifiedObjects` field for all object storage
- **Home Page** - Simplified to main dashboard only; quick actions fixed at 90×90; inline page editor moved to object workspace
- **Custom Page Trash** - Page-type children no longer display in parent workspace (hierarchy visible only in sidebar tree)
- **Object Editor Save** - Save button moved from AppBar to bottom-centered outline button
- **Multi-account Session Persistence** - `sessionToken` and `currentAccount` are now persisted to localStorage
- **Session Validation** - Fixed closure capture bug in auth page redirects using `getState()` pattern
- **Settings Page** - Change Master Password section is now collapsed by default
- **Dashboard** - Simplified toolbar, account info moved to shared Header
- **Vault ChangePassword** - Now properly re-encrypts all profile data with new key

### Fixed
- **Data Persistence on Login** - `UnifiedObjectNotifier` now auto-loads from `ProfileData` via `ref.listen` and explicit `loadFromProfile()` calls on login
- **Lock Button Stucking** - Added try-finally in settings page to ensure button state is restored on error
- **Change Password Flow** - Wrong current password now returns proper error message instead of hanging
- **SetVaultPath Index Loading** - Fixed missing `loadIndex()` call when switching account vaults
- **Account Deletion Lock** - Delete account now properly locks and redirects to login

### Security
- **Argon2id Performance** - Rust SIMD implementation provides ~3x speedup on Apple M-series chips
- **Password Change Re-encryption** - All vault data is now properly re-encrypted when password changes
