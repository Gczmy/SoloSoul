## [1.7.0] - 2026-06-02

### Added

- **Attachment Sync** — Devices now sync attachments alongside structured data. No more orphaned references when switching devices.
- **Backup Deduplication** — Backups share a single attachment pool via manifest references. 5 backups with 100 MB attachments now use ~100 MB instead of 500 MB.
- **Data Management Dashboard** — Vault info card now displays attachment size, count, and total footprint for full transparency.
- **AI Chat Enhancements** — Multi-conversation support, trash/recovery for deleted chats, message timestamps, and automatic plugin context injection for richer AI responses.
- **User Guides** — In-app guide system with Notion-style rendering. Settings page and home screen now include quick-access help entries and plugin feature guides.
- **Windows Support** — Rust FFI native library now compiles for Windows (preparation for future Windows client).

### Fixed

- Backups now correctly include attachments (previously only profile data was saved).
- Backup size display no longer double-counts shared attachment pool files.

## [1.6.8] - 2026-05-31

### Added

- **Attachment Trash & Recovery** — Attachments now support soft-delete with a 30-day recovery window. Deleted attachments move to the object-level trash where they can be restored or permanently deleted.
- **One-Click Attachment Download** — New download button in the attachment sheet saves files directly to your system Downloads folder. Automatically handles filename conflicts (e.g. `report (1).pdf`).
- **Custom Download Location** — Settings page now allows configuring a custom download directory. Falls back to system Downloads if the custom path becomes unavailable (e.g. macOS sandbox changes).
- **Attachment Preview Enhancement** — PDF attachments can now be previewed inline using `pdfx`. Image previews support full-screen zoom with pan and dismiss gestures.
- **Inline Add Section Button** — The floating "+" action button has been replaced with a dashed-border "Add Section" card at the end of every page content stream. Works consistently across workspace pages, default pages (Profile/Travel/Financial/Professional), and the root object list.

### Fixed

- **Account Duplicate Name Protection** — Creating an account with an existing name now correctly returns an error instead of silently deleting the old account data.
- **JSON Serialization Consistency** — Fixed `@JsonKey` annotation mismatch for `semanticTypes` and `propertyLabels`, ensuring `toMap()` and `fromJson()` use the same keys (`__semanticTypes`, `__propertyLabels`).
- **Download Robustness** — Added write-permission validation before downloading. Prevents crashes when the configured download directory is no longer writable.
- **Concurrent Download Guard** — Prevents duplicate download triggers when rapidly tapping the download button.
- **Orphan File Prevention** — `permanentlyDeleteAttachment` now throws an exception when `accountId` is null, preventing orphaned encrypted files on disk.
- **macOS Sandbox Fallback** — When the custom download path becomes invalid (common after macOS app restart in sandbox), downloads automatically fall back to the system Downloads folder.

### Refactored

- **Plugin Event Handler** — Split the 285-line `_onRun` method into 6 focused handler methods plus a `_PluginRunSession` state class, reducing nesting depth from 7 to 2 levels.
- **Object Editor Save Flow** — Split `_saveObject` into `_validateSaveInput` and `_buildProperties` with a `_PropertyBuildResult` data class, eliminating 6-layer nested logic.
- **Password Dialog Deduplication** — Extracted `_PasswordDialogBaseMixin` shared by two dialog variants, removing ~100 lines of duplicated field/controller/lifecycle logic.
- **OCR Processing Pipeline** — Extracted `_processOcrBytes` to unify the OCR → MRZ → field extraction flow, removing ~80 lines of duplicated code between image and document pickers.
- **Default Structure Factory** — Extracted `_buildPage` / `_buildSection` factory methods for reuse between `_createDefaultStructure` and `_migrateDefaultSectionSchemas`.
- **LLM Config Deduplication** — Extracted `_activeProfile` helper in `llm_config_service`, eliminating repeated active-profile lookups across 5 getters.
- **Icon Lookup Optimization** — Replaced the 114-line `switch` in `getIconFromName` with a `Map` constant table, reducing code by ~70 lines.
- **Parallel I/O Operations** — Attachment deletions during `updateObject`, `permanentlyDeleteObject`, and `permanentlyDeleteMultiple` now run in parallel via `Future.wait` instead of sequential awaits.
- **O(n) → O(1) Lookups** — `semantic_type_registry.getType` and `recommend` lookups now use pre-built `Map`/`Set` for constant-time access instead of linear scans.

### Test Infrastructure

- **Injectable FFI Wrappers** — Added `_saltGenerator` and `_keyDeriver` function pointers to `SecureAccountStorage`, allowing unit tests to mock Rust crypto operations without initializing `flutter_rust_bridge`.
- **Full Test Suite Green** — All 902 unit tests now pass (0 failures), up from 16 pre-existing failures caused by stale `typeId` formats and missing FFI initialization.

## [1.6.7] - 2026-05-31

### Fixed

- **Crash Prevention** — Eliminated ~166 potential null-dereference crash sites across the codebase through safer null-handling patterns
- **Security Hardening** — Validated file paths before external command execution to prevent injection attacks
- **Memory Stability** — Fixed timer and stream subscription leaks that could accumulate during extended app usage

- **Card UI Polish** — Collapse threshold lowered to 1 item; persistent add button; cleaner header layout
- **Title Handling** — Fixed duplicate Title fields and ensured Title always appears first in item cards
- **First-Launch Offline** — Plugin market works without internet on first launch
